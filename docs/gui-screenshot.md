# GUI Screenshot Placeholder

Since this is a text-based environment, a screenshot cannot be generated automatically.

To add a real screenshot:

1. Run the GUI: `python3 run_gui.py`
2. Take a screenshot of the application window
3. Save it as `docs/gui-screenshot.png`
4. The README will automatically reference it

## Expected Screenshot Content

The screenshot should show:
- Dark themed interface with LunarBit colors
- Left panel with configuration options
- Right panel with output log
- Modern card-based layout
- "LunarBit Modpack Updater" title with rocket emoji

## Recommended Screenshot Settings

- **Size**: Approximately 900x700 pixels (the default window size)
- **Format**: PNG for best quality
- **Content**: Show the interface with some sample configuration filled in
- **State**: Capture during or after an update to show the output log in action
