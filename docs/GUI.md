## Usage

1. **Launch**: Run `python3 run_gui.py` or use the platform-specific launchers
2. **Select Modpack**: Click "Browse" to choose your modpack folder or .mrpack file
3. **Configure Options**: Enable client/server generation as needed
4. **Update**: Click "üöÄ Update Modpack" to start the process
5. **Monitor**: Watch the real-time output for progress and results

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+Q**: Quit application (on supported platforms)
- **Escape**: Stop running update (when focused on stop button)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- tkinter (included with most Python installations)
- All dependencies from `requirements.txt`

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Won't Start
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Check that tkinter is available: `python3 -c "import tkinter"`
- Try running directly: `python3 gui.py`

### No Output During Update
- The GUI runs the CLI script in the background
- Output should appear in real-time in the right panel
- Check that `update_modpack.py` exists in the same directory

### Styling Issues
- The GUI automatically configures its theme
- If colors look wrong, check your system's display settings
- Try restarting the application
