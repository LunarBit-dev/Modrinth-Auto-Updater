## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible

### Code Structure

- Keep the main script modular with separate functions for distinct operations
- Add proper error handling with informative error messages
- Use the existing color coding system for terminal output
- Follow the existing pattern for API calls and error handling

### Example Code Style

```python
def get_mod_info(project_slug: str) -> Dict[str, Any] | None:
    """
    Retrieve mod information from Modrinth API.
    
    Args:
        project_slug: The project slug from Modrinth
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing mod info, or None if not found
    """
    try:
        url = f"{MODRINTH_API}/project/{project_slug}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"{Colors.RED}Error fetching mod info: {e}{Colors.RESET}")
        return None
```

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

3. Verify that existing functionality still works
4. Test error handling with invalid inputs
